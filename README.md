# Fantasy Premier League Dashboard
Fantasy Premier League Dashboard using Dash &amp; Plotly

A dashboard about Fantasy Premier League Game.
A game is played by over 8 million players each year and there is a big well-collected dataset 
available to use, so I thought it would be nice if we made this dataset and numbers easy to read and interact with it visually using Plotly, As you can see in the images, we were able to present different information about a single player and team in two simple graphs.
